    <h2><center>Welcome to A Grand Experience</center></h2>

      <p><center>I have a website!!!! </center></p>


      <p> I can track my progress and collect and organize a portfolio if i wanted to. At the very least it will be great for playing around with and practicing! Even if I do none of that this is cool.
       <br>I like the fact that its mine and I can eassily share what im working on with anyone by simply saying, "If you want to see what I've been doing just go to griffingrand.com"
       <br>It makes it seem like an impressive thing.</p>
