        <h1><br>Past</h1>
        <p> I grew up in Lilburn, Ga, which is roughly 30 mins outside of Atlanta. I have had a bit of a wayward life path so far. For most of high school I worked at a movie theater and with the money I was able to save up went to New York for two weeks before starting college. I was in college for two semesters before dropping out, I have work a variety of different job in the time since then. I&apos;ve worked in manufacturing gaining experience running an industrial printer and a CNC machine. I&apos;ve worked in the service industry drawing on my ability to provide quality customer service. I&apos;ve done solely food delivery as my income source requiring self discipline/time management. I&apos;ve work in the eye care industry as an ophthalmic laboratory technician, running the machine which would edge the lens for glasses, then mounting the lenses into the glasses frame.</p>
