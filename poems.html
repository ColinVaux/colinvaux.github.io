          <h1><br>City Lights</h1>
          <p>City nights <br>
            And city lights <br>
            And many lives to see <br>
            <br>
            In timeless memories<br>
            Shaped by them<br>
            To shape then who they&apos;ll be<br>
            <br>
            Their story&apos;s<br>
            Are their memories<br>
            And they keep making more<br>
            <br>
            See their hunger<br>
            And such zest for life<br>
            Strikes me to my core<br>
            <br>
            In some<br>
            I see resilience and<br>
            In some a lack of strife<br>
            <br>
            An undergrad<br>
            holds their coffee,<br>
            Two hold hands, husband and wife<br>
            <br>
            A couple<br>
            holding cardboard signs<br>
            Are just hoping for change<br>
            <br>
            Handed a twenty<br>
            From a stock broker<br>
            Who just made an exchange<br>
            <br>
            A woman talking<br>
            On the phone<br>
            To her sister living abroad<br>
            <br>
            Evangelists<br>
            Hand pamphlets out<br>
            Telling all about their god<br>
            <br>
            A man walks<br>
            With his boyfriend<br>
            Who tonight plans to propose<br>
            <br>
            Though without<br>
            Their father&apos;s blessings<br>
            That&apos;s just sometimes how that goes<br>
            <br>
            An officer<br>
            Patrols the block<br>
            Like clock work on the beat<br>
            <br>
            So predictable<br>
            The local plug<br>
            Can alway be discreet<br>
            <br>
            A waiter<br>
            Heading home<br>
            Stands while waiting for the bus<br>
            <br>
            A parent<br>
            Picks their baby up<br>
            So it stops making a fuss<br>
            <br>
            The bus driver<br>
            Keeps eyes ahead<br>
            Running from up to down<br>
            <br>
            Then runs from down<br>
            Back up again<br>
            The bus cycles the town<br>
            <br>
            And a poet<br>
            with a wandering eye<br>
            Went wandering tonight<br>
            <br>
            What he saw<br>
            The little things in life<br>
            And in them he found delight</p>

          <p>Rain on the roads<br>

            city lights drove<br>
            Through the dark<br>
            With a glare<br>
            <br>
            Wind rushing in<br>
            After hours of rush<br>
            Sparse in travelers<br>
            five lane road<br>
            Filled with a hush<br>
            <br>
            Feeling a part<br>
            Of this feeling apart<br>
            We the stragglers<br>
            Staggering home<br>
            To restart<br>
            <br>
            And the energy felt<br>
            From the storm up ahead<br>
            Giving promise of a<br>
            thunderous pour<br>
            Once in bed<br>
            <br>
            And for just a moment<br>
            All that does consist<br>
            The journey<br>
            The promise<br>
            While we still exist<br>

          <p>Dear Mr. Stylistic<br>
            What style will you pick today?<br>
            <br>
            To say your sentiments<br>
            Like sediment<br>
            settles down<br>
            And erodes away<br>
            <br>
            To say your drive<br>
            Is poison ivy<br>
            You despise<br>
            The dreadful itch<br>
            <br>
            To say your lies<br>
            Just the oxygen<br>
            Mind sits within<br>
            Dark pitch<br>
            <br>
            That your doubt<br>
            Is the ignition<br>
            Felt them flip<br>
            Ignitions switched<br>
            <br>
            Then the flames<br>
            Of your self hatred<br>
            Burns each thread<br>
            Of thought thats stitched<br>
            <br>
            But all thought<br>
            Is an illusion<br>
            Disillusion<br>
            Tempers regret<br>
            <br>
            Your mind<br>
            Plagued by intrusions<br>
            To that end fear<br>
            Steers your set<br>
            <br>
            Will you never let up<br>
            How you ever fret<br>
            what others view<br>
            of you will be<br>

          <p>If there&apos;s beauty in not knowing<br>
            Does that beauty live unknown<br>
            Do the thoughts within me growing<br>
            Stem from someone else&apos;s poem<br>
            <br>
            And Is that all that I am<br>
            a plot of land, the world to seed<br>
            Tending&apos;s hard not knowing,<br>
            Let what root and what to weed<br>
            <br>
            And can this land, this soil bear<br>
            some fruit worthy to eat<br>
            Could life even survive here<br>
            Climate of bitter, cold and heat<br>
            <br>
            impossible to pull from a fossils skull<br>
            The world which within did gleam<br>
            But those fossils make my soil full<br>
            within me oil flows in a stream<br>
            <br>
            And so another midnight burn<br>
            As I churn some more out of me<br>
            to watch the dark of oil turn<br>
            to sternly claim the dark from night<br>
            and it sets me free
